## 🛠️ Skills I Used
- **JavaScript:** For game logic and movement.
- **HTML & CSS:** For the game structure and design.
- **Problem Solving:** Creating win and lose conditions.

## 🚀 How it Works
Each game is in its own folder. To run a game, you just need to open the **`index.html`** file in a browser. 

The `index.html` file is the main file. It automatically connects the `style.css` (design) and `script.js` (logic) so the game can work perfectly.
